# VIPER: Vision-based system to detect potential predators for herding with robots

This repository introduces a vision system designed for deployment within a ROS2 node to enable autonomous flock herding by detecting potential predators, such as wolves. A pre-trained YOLOv8 model and a pre-trained YOLOv9 model have been fine-tuned to incorporate additional classes not originally supported, including wolves. The models have been re-trained using both the COCO dataset and a newly curated dataset while preserving recognition of previously learned classes alongside the new ones. To achieve this, a dataset of wolf images in open environments was collected and annotated for instance segmentation. The resulting vision model is integrated into a ROS2 node, allowing deployment on robotic platforms such as quadruped robots or rovers. With this vision-based system, a robot can detect potential predators and provide valuable information to the herder, helping to avoid areas where the flock may be at risk. This technology has the potential to enhance extensive livestock farming by assisting in daily herding tasks.
